# Django-Project-Automation

A little automation project.

ShutIt is an automation project that models a user's actions on a terminal.

It can automate Django Startproject process that can be run by a human on the command line with little effort.

It was originally written to manage complex Settings builds, but is a now general-purpose automation tool that supports bash build contexts.


Really Quick Overview
=====================
Some use cases:

- You like Python and Django, want to automate tasks for creating django project, have structure and support, but don't want to learn a configuration management framework that takes you away from the command line you know and love.

- Are interested in "Python Automation".

- You're programmer who wants highly configurable stateless containers development, testing, and production.


What Does it Do ?
==============================

Here is a simple example of a script that creates a file and a directory if they are not there already:

1. Let's rename //my-work-project-path to //your-work-project-path in Files.
2. Run .my_commands.sh file
3. Hit Command **Create Projectname Appname**

It Automatic Create Project and App Inside Your Work path
It Also Add Static and Template Path In settings.py

That's All...
